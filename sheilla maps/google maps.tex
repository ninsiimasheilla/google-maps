\section{Introduction}
Google maps is a web mapping service developed by google.it offers satellite imagery, real-time traffic conditions and route planning for travelling by foot, car, bicycle or public transportation. 
Google maps begun as a c++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Elistrup Rasmussen at where 2 technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and REALTIME TRAFFIC ANALYZER, Google maps was launched in February 2005\cite{s1}. The service’s front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax.
Google maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third party websites,and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google map maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service’s mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March,2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google maps were not discontinued as the company announced those features will be transferred to Google Local Guides program\cite{s3}.
Google maps’ satellite view is a “top-down” view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 240 to 460m, while most other imagery is from satellites . Google maps uses a close variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles.
The current redesigned version of the desktop application in 2013, alongside the “classic” (pre-2013) version. Google maps for android and iOS devices was released 2008 and features GPS turn-by-turn-navigation along with the dedicated parking assistance features. In August 2013, it was determined to be the world’s most popular application for smartphones, with over 54 of the global smartphone owners using it at least once \cite{s5}.
In 2012, Google reported having over 7100 employees and contractors directly working in mapping. \cite{s4}

\section{Views from users}
Users claim the app is nice for GPS navigation where it is helpful for one’s destination.
Users also claim the app creator is using Google maps with a horrible interface in that every time one clicks on something, it brings up an ad to include trying to exit the application.
